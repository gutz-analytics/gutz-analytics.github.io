# Multi-Omics Companion Diagnostics for Pharmaceutical Development

We develop AI-powered companion diagnostics to de-risk Phase 3 clinical trials and rescue failed assets in oncology, autoimmune, and neurological therapeutic areas.

Our proprietary Dynomics platform integrates microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data with exponential accuracy scaling—doubling omics layers yields 5x improvement in patient stratification.
