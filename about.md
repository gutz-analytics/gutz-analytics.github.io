## Company Overview

Gutz Analytics is pioneering multi-omics AI technology for companion diagnostic development in pharmaceutical clinical trials. Over 5 years, we have built the Dynomics platform, integrating microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data to stratify patients and predict treatment response.

We work with pharmaceutical companies to de-risk Phase 3 clinical trials and rescue failed assets in oncology, autoimmune, and neurological therapeutic areas.

### The Dynomics Platform

**Proprietary Database:** 1 million curated samples across microbiome and host transcriptome, enabling robust biomarker discovery and validation.

**Exponential Accuracy Scaling:** Our multi-omics integration delivers exponential improvements in patient stratification—doubling the number of omics layers yields 5x improvement in forecasting accuracy.

**Proven Methodology:** Published in leading scientific journals including Nature Neuroscience, Nature Methods, and Nature Biotechnology.

**Active Research:** Ongoing collaborations demonstrating prediction of immunotherapy response in lung cancer and clinical outcome prediction across multiple disease areas.

## Leadership Team

Our team brings together leading experts in multi-omics AI, bioinformatics, and computational biology.

## Platform Validation Through Published Research

Our methodology is validated through peer-reviewed publications demonstrating our capability to integrate multi-omics data for patient stratification and biological subtyping.

### [Multi-level analysis of the gut–brain axis shows autism spectrum disorder-associated molecular and microbial profiles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01361-0)
*Nature Neuroscience*

**Platform Relevance:** Demonstrates our ability to identify disease subtypes from multi-omics microbiome data. The same methodology is applied to identify drug responder vs non-responder populations in clinical trials.

### [Learning representations of microbe–metabolite interactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0616-3)
*Nature Methods*

**Platform Relevance:** Models how microbiome composition affects metabolite profiles. This approach predicts how patient-specific microbiomes will metabolize and respond to therapeutic compounds.

### [Protein remote homology detection and structural alignment using deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01917-2)
*Nature Biotechnology*

**Platform Relevance:** Demonstrates our AI capability for complex biological pattern recognition across high-dimensional data.

### [Establishing microbial composition measurement standards with reference frames](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10656-5)
*Nature Communications*

**Platform Relevance:** Foundational work on microbiome measurement standardization, critical for developing robust clinical diagnostics.
