## Company Overview

Gutz Analytics builds AI models to better understand human disease through subtyping. Our mission: lower patient care costs and pave the path for treatments that actually work.

Our Dynomics platform uses Dynamic Variational Autoencoders (DVAE) to create digital twins from multi-omics data—microbiome, metabolomics, proteomics, genomics—enabling precision approaches that match treatments to individual biology.

### Our Current Focus: Autism Spectrum Disorder

We're applying our platform to autism, where we've achieved >80% prediction accuracy in our published meta-analysis. Our *Nature Neuroscience* publication established the autism-gut-brain axis connection, and we're validating our approach through collaborations with leading research institutions.

### Broader Applications

The same platform powers applications in oncology (immunotherapy response), autoimmune diseases, and other neurological conditions—demonstrating the broad utility of our disease subtyping approach.
