# Partner Logos - Usage Guidelines & Download Instructions

This document outlines the usage restrictions and download procedures for partner institution logos.

---

## NIAID (National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS

**The NIAID logo CANNOT be used without explicit permission.**

**Usage Restrictions:**
- The NIAID logo is reserved for **official NIAID communications** only
- This applies to ALL private sector individuals and organizations, including grantees, vendors, and contractors
- NIAID-funded researchers may **credit NIAID in text** on their websites, but **cannot use the NIAID logo**
- The logo should **not be combined** with other elements to create a new logo

### Alternative Approach (Recommended)

Instead of using the NIAID logo, use text-based acknowledgment:

```
"In collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)"
```

Or a simple badge/text design without the official logo.

### If Logo Permission is Needed

1. Visit: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/copyright-and-reuse
2. Contact NIAID directly for permission
3. Provide URL, file name, and intended use

### Logo File (IF PERMISSION GRANTED)

- Available at: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US-NIH-NIAID-Logo.svg
- Format: SVG (vector)
- **Do not download/use unless you have explicit permission**

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

Given the strict usage restrictions, here are your options:

### Option 1: Text-Based Acknowledgment (SAFEST)

Instead of using logos, use professionally designed text badges:

```html
<div class="collaboration">
  <div class="collaboration-badge">
    <h4>National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</h4>
    <p>COVID-19 treatment response prediction</p>
  </div>

  <div class="collaboration-badge">
    <h4>NYU Langone Medical Center</h4>
    <p>Lung cancer immunotherapy response prediction</p>
  </div>

  <div class="collaboration-badge">
    <h4>University of Calgary</h4>
    <p>Ulcerative colitis patient stratification</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Option 2: Request Permission (RECOMMENDED)

**Steps:**
1. Draft a permission request email explaining:
   - The collaboration/research partnership
   - How the logo will be used (website showcase of active research)
   - That it will be presented professionally alongside research description
   - Website URL and mockup if possible

2. Send requests to:
   - NIAID: Via https://www.niaid.nih.gov/global/copyright-and-reuse
   - NYU Langone: Via https://brandcenter.med.nyu.edu/request-access/
   - University of Calgary: brand@ucalgary.ca

3. Wait for approval before implementation

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (IMMEDIATE)

Use text acknowledgment now, replace with logos later once permission is granted:

```
Current implementation: Text-based badges (no logos)
After permission granted: Add logos to badges
```
