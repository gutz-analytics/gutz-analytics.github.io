# Gutz Analytics Website Redesign Plan

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025
**Goal:** Generate client leads and attract investor attention through clear, compelling messaging focused on core technology platform

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Problem
The existing website positions Gutz Analytics narrowly around specific pharmaceutical applications (CDx, drug rescue) rather than showcasing the core technology platform. This limits perceived scope and fails to communicate the fundamental innovation.

### New Vision
Reposition as a **multi-omics AI platform company** that approximates human biology to predict treatment response. Applications like drug repurposing, companion diagnostics, and drug rescue are demonstrated use cases, not the core identity.

### Key Strategic Shifts
1. **From:** "We do companion diagnostics" → **To:** "We build AI that approximates human biology"
2. **From:** Application-first messaging → **To:** Technology-first with application examples
3. **From:** Service provider → **To:** Advanced technology partner with locally-deployable AI
4. **From:** Cluttered multi-service layout → **To:** Clean, data-driven technical presentation

### Positioning for Dual Audience

**For Pharmaceutical/Biotech Clients:**
"Academic validation complete, transitioning to commercial deployment. Be an early partner in deploying battle-tested multi-omics AI for your therapeutic programs."

**For Investors:**
"De-risked through years of academic validation (NIAID, NYU, leading universities; Nature publications; government grants) before commercial launch. Proven science + established platform (scikit-bio with thousands of users) + massive proprietary dataset + untapped market = outsized opportunity."

**Key Advantage:** Most AI health startups launch with unproven technology. Gutz Analytics has:
- **Proven platform:** Scikit-bio with thousands of active users globally
- **Academic validation:** Nature publications, NIAID/NIH collaborations, top-tier medical centers
- **Government backing:** DOE-funded research
- **Proprietary data moat:** 1M+ curated samples
- **Now commercializing** for clinical applications with deployment-ready architecture

---

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Style: Technical & Data-Driven
- Scientific aesthetic with professional credibility
- Data visualizations and technical illustrations throughout
- Clean layouts with purposeful white space
- Color palette: Professional blues/teals with accent colors for data viz
- Typography: Modern, readable fonts that work for both technical content and executive summaries

### Content Approach: Medium Technical Depth
- Lead with business/clinical impact, support with technical credibility
- Explain the "what" and "why" without overwhelming detail
- Link to deeper technical resources for those who want them
- Balance accessibility for executives with substance for technical evaluators
