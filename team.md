    <h3>James Morton, PhD</h3>
    <p class="team-title">Founder & CEO</p>
    <p class="team-bio">Dr. James Morton is a pioneer in biostatistical and machine learning methodologies for multi-omics applications, with research published in Nature Neuroscience, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Methods, and Nature Communications. He received his PhD in Computer Science from UC San Diego and founded Gutz Analytics in 2019 after serving as an investigator at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), where he led development of biostatistical methods for high-dimensional, multi-modal longitudinal modeling. His work spans compositional data analysis for microbiome and metabolome integration, differentiable sequence alignment algorithms leveraging large language models for protein structure prediction, and Bayesian differential abundance methods that account for batch effects across multi-omics datasets.</p>

    <h3>Jonathan Sanders, PhD</h3>
    <p class="team-title">Co-Founder & CSO</p>
    <p class="team-bio">Dr. Jonathan Sanders is an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatician with nearly two decades at the forefront of animal gut microbiome research. He earned his PhD in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology from Harvard University and has contributed to over 75 papers in journals including Science, Nature, and PNAS. Jon led efforts at UC San Diego to automate and miniaturize high-throughput shotgun metagenomic protocols, resulting in publications in Genome Biology and generation of one of the largest metagenomic cohorts assembled at the time. With expertise spanning wet lab specimen processing to computational analysis of massive datasets, Jon has developed flexible cloud-based pipelines and inexpensive genomics protocols that enable rapid characterization of microbial isolates for academic and industry applications.</p>
