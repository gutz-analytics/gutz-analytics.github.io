# De-Risk Phase 3 Trials with Multi-Omics Patient Stratification

Gutz Analytics develops AI-powered companion diagnostics for oncology, autoimmune, and neurological diseases by integrating microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data to identify patient responders.

## The Dynomics Advantage

Our proprietary Dynomics platform delivers exponential improvements in patient stratification accuracy through multi-omics integration.

**Proven Performance:** Doubling the number of omics layers yields 5x improvement in forecasting accuracy, as demonstrated in our clinical prediction research.

**Unparalleled Data:** 1 million curated samples across microbiome and host transcriptome, built over 5 years of development.

**Pharma-Validated:** Working with multiple pharmaceutical companies on clinical trial stratification and companion diagnostic development.

## Two Critical Applications

### Phase 3 Trial De-Risking
Design companion diagnostics before your trial to identify responder populations. Enrich patient enrollment to increase probability of success in oncology immunotherapies, autoimmune biologics, and CNS therapeutics.

### Failed Asset Rescue
Retrospective multi-omics analysis of Phase 2/3 trial data to identify patient subpopulations where your therapy demonstrates efficacy. Develop companion diagnostics for refined indications and regulatory approval pathways.

## Research-Backed Platform

Our methodology is validated through publications in Nature Neuroscience, Nature Methods, and Nature Biotechnology, with ongoing research demonstrating:
- Prediction of immunotherapy response in lung cancer
- Multi-omics integration for clinical outcome prediction
- Patient stratification in neurological and autoimmune disorders
