Rescue failed Phase 3 assets by identifying patient responder subpopulations through retrospective multi-omics analysis.

### Post-Hoc Multi-Omics Analysis
Your therapy failed Phase 3, but showed efficacy signals in patient subsets. We perform comprehensive multi-omics analysis of trial data to identify responder populations and develop companion diagnostics for refined regulatory pathways.

**The Opportunity:**
Failed Phase 3 trials represent billions in lost investment, yet many contain hidden responder populations where the therapy demonstrates significant efficacy. Identifying these populations enables refined indications and companion diagnostic-based approval strategies.

**Our Approach:**
Retrospective integration of microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data from your trial. Our Dynomics platform identifies multi-omics signatures distinguishing responders from non-responders with exponentially improved accuracy.

### Rescue Scenarios by Therapeutic Area

**Oncology:**
Your immunotherapy demonstrated 30% overall response in Phase 3. Multi-omics analysis identifies a patient subset with 70% response based on microbiome and immune transcriptome signatures. Develop companion diagnostic for refined indication approval.

**Autoimmune:**
Your IBD therapy showed modest overall benefit. We identify responder microbiome signatures enabling companion diagnostic development for a targeted patient population with robust treatment effect.

**Neurological:**
Your CNS therapeutic failed on primary endpoints. Gut-brain axis multi-omics analysis identifies responsive patient subpopulations, providing path to stratified approval or adaptive trial design.

### Exponential Accuracy Through Multi-Omics
Leverage all available trial data. Doubling omics layers yields 5x improvement in forecasting accuracy, maximizing ability to identify true responder populations versus statistical noise.

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive responder vs non-responder multi-omics analysis
- Identified biomarker signatures for companion diagnostic development
- Patient stratification strategy for refined indication
- Regulatory pathway recommendations (510(k), PMA, LDT)
- Scientific publication support demonstrating stratified efficacy

### Path Forward
Following responder identification, we support companion diagnostic validation, regulatory strategy, and potential adaptive trial design or new trial with enriched enrollment.
