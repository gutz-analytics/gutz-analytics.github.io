Design multi-omics companion diagnostics to stratify patients and predict treatment response in oncology, autoimmune, and neurological disorders.

### Multi-Omics Biomarker Discovery
Integrate microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data to identify predictive biomarkers for drug response. Our exponential accuracy scaling delivers 5x improvement in forecasting accuracy when doubling the number of omics layers.

**Oncology Applications:**
- Predict immunotherapy response in checkpoint inhibitor trials
- Stratify patients for targeted therapies
- Identify microbiome signatures associated with treatment efficacy

**Autoimmune Applications:**
- Predict biologic response in IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions
- Identify inflammatory phenotypes through multi-omics integration
- Stratify patients for personalized treatment selection

**Neurological Applications:**
- Leverage gut-brain axis biology for CNS drug response prediction
- Identify disease subtypes from multi-omics microbiome data
- Predict drug metabolism and efficacy in neurological disorders

### Validation and Regulatory Support
Leverage our proprietary database of 1 million curated samples to validate biomarkers and develop robust companion diagnostics. We provide regulatory strategy support for FDA biomarker qualification and companion diagnostic approval pathways.

### Dynomics Platform Integration
Our proprietary Dynomics framework integrates all available omics data types, boosting statistical power through deep neural networks and enabling non-linear dynamical modeling on complex multi-omics datasets.
