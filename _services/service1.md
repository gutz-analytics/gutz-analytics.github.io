We develop multi-omics companion diagnostics to identify patient responder populations in oncology, autoimmune, and neurological clinical trials—whether you're approaching Phase 3 or seeking to rescue a failed asset.

## The Dynomics Platform Advantage

Our proprietary platform integrates microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, and transcriptomics data to identify multi-omics signatures that predict treatment response.

**Exponential Accuracy Scaling:** Doubling the number of omics layers yields 5x improvement in forecasting accuracy, enabling robust patient stratification even in complex heterogeneous populations.

**Proprietary Database:** 1 million curated samples across microbiome and host transcriptome provide unprecedented validation power for biomarker discovery.

**Proven Methodology:** Published in Nature journals and validated through pharmaceutical collaborations across multiple therapeutic areas.

## Two Critical Applications

### Prospective: De-Risk Phase 3 Trials

Design companion diagnostics before your Phase 3 trial to identify and enrich for patient responders.

**The Challenge:** Phase 3 trials fail at rates exceeding 50%, often due to patient heterogeneity masking treatment effects in responsive subpopulations. Average costs: $100M-$300M.

**Our Solution:** Analyze Phase 1/2 data or existing datasets to identify multi-omics biomarkers predicting treatment response. Design companion diagnostics for prospective patient selection, increasing statistical power and trial success probability.

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Oncology:** Your checkpoint inhibitor shows 35% response in Phase 2. We develop companion diagnostics to enrich for responders, targeting 60%+ response in Phase 3.
- **Autoimmune:** Your biologic shows variable response. We identify multi-omics signatures predicting responders for stratified enrollment.
- **Neurological:** Your CNS drug demonstrates efficacy in subsets. We leverage gut-brain axis biomarkers to enrich for responsive patients.

### Retrospective: Rescue Failed Assets

Identify patient responder subpopulations from failed Phase 3 trials through retrospective multi-omics analysis.

**The Opportunity:** Failed Phase 3 trials represent billions in lost investment, yet many contain hidden responder populations where therapy demonstrates significant efficacy. Identifying these populations enables refined indications and companion diagnostic-based approval strategies.

**Our Approach:** Comprehensive integration of microbiome, metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data from your trial. Our platform identifies multi-omics signatures distinguishing responders from non-responders with exponentially improved accuracy.

**Rescue Scenarios:**
- **Oncology:** Your immunotherapy showed 30% overall response. Multi-omics analysis identifies a subset with 70% response based on microbiome and immune transcriptome signatures.
- **Autoimmune:** Your IBD therapy showed modest overall benefit. We identify responder microbiome signatures for targeted patient population approval.
- **Neurological:** Your CNS therapeutic failed on primary endpoints. Gut-brain axis analysis identifies responsive subpopulations for stratified approval or adaptive trial design.

## Therapeutic Area Expertise

We focus on therapeutic areas where microbiome and multi-omics integration provide maximum clinical value:

**Oncology**
- Immunotherapy response prediction
- Tumor microbiome-immune interactions
- Treatment-related adverse event prediction

**Autoimmune Disorders**
- Biologic response in IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, MS
- Inflammatory phenotype identification
- Disease subtype stratification

**Neurological Diseases**
- Gut-brain axis biomarkers for CNS drugs
- Neuroinflammatory disease stratification
- Drug metabolism prediction

## Deliverables

**Biomarker Discovery:**
- Multi-omics biomarker panel predicting treatment response
- Mechanistic insights into responder biology
- Validation across our 1M sample database

**Companion Diagnostic Development:**
- Clinical assay protocol and validation plan
- Patient stratification algorithm
- Regulatory pathway strategy (FDA biomarker qualification, 510(k), PMA, or LDT)

**Clinical & Regulatory Support:**
- Protocol design for stratified trials
- Statistical analysis plan for companion diagnostic validation
- Scientific publication support demonstrating stratified efficacy
- Adaptive trial design recommendations (for rescue scenarios)

## Why Multi-Omics Integration Matters

Single-omics approaches miss critical interactions. Patient microbiome composition affects drug metabolism, immune response, and inflammation—but the effects are only fully captured when integrating:
- **Microbiome composition** (who's there)
- **Metabolomics** (what they're doing)
- **Host genomics** (patient genetics)
- **Host transcriptomics** (patient immune/metabolic state)

Our platform reveals patterns no single omics layer can detect, maximizing your ability to identify true responder populations versus statistical noise.
